# Arduino-Alarm-Clock
We are now starting a new video series to provide our customers with better tutorials for the making, and all of the projects will be Arduino and 3D Printing related.
The first tutorial will start from your everyday life: An Arduino Alarm Clock!
Not only to display time and ring the alarm, but it can also monitor the temperature of your room. The shell is easily 3D printed and all electronic parts are included in our UNO Super Starter Kit.
